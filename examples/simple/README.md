# Simple sending emulation script

I use it for acceptance testing of this gem. This code should be always working, if not, please open an issue.

# Setup
No need for setup

# Running
Install gem deps,
then just add execution permission to the script and run it:

```sh
$ bundle install
$ chmod +x send.rb
$ ./send.rb
```
